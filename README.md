# ETL-Mini-Project

# This repository contains the code for an ETL project, where we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and regular expressions to extract and transform data from Excel files. The transformed data was then stored in CSV files, which were used to create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. Finally, the CSV data was uploaded into a Postgres database.
